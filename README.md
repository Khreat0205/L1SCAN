# Deciphering Active Retrotransposition-Competent L1HS in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma through Single-Cell ATAC-Seq Analysis

The development of cancer is significantly influenced by somatic mutations, including structural events triggered by Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (L1) retrotransposons. Technical difficulties at the single-cell level have restricted the research of L1 retrotransposition in cancer, despite its importance. In this study, leveraging single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) data, we identified active L1 retrotransposon loci in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients, including specific activities in endothelial cells, both of monocytes and TAM (or macrophage in validation data), and ccRCC cells. Three unique L1HS loci with tumor-specific activity in ccRCC were identified by our investigation, providing insight into their possible function. Additionally, the activity of ZNF320 itself was significantly higher in ccRCC cells than in normal cells, suggesting its role as a pioneer factor in the modulation of these L1HS loci. This finding provides insight into their possible function and underscores the potential regulatory mechanism involving ZNF320 in the activation of L1 elements in ccRCC. We also looked into the relationship between these activity groups and clinical parameters, and the results showed some interesting relationships with tumor stage and patient age. Our results highlight the potential of scATAC-seq to uncover important tumor markers and show its effectiveness in accurately assessing L1 element activity. By providing a greater knowledge of the role played by L1 retrotransposon in the progression of cancer and its clinical implications, this study opens the door for future diagnostic and treatment approaches that specifically target L1-related events in the management of cancer.
